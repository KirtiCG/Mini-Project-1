            how we met!
        </h2>
        <p>
            We met through a mutual freind who went to my high school but lives in the same neighborhood as my roomate.
            We met for coffee over the summer and I also met her twin sister that day. We ended up really liking each other and we talked for hours.
            After that day, we knew we would be great roommates!

            moving in!
        </h3>
        <p>
            On move in day I was super nervous to say goobye to my old life and start over somewhere new. I definitely cried many times throughout the day.
            My roommate, on the other hand, was super excited and couldn't wait for the independence of moving out. She really helped cheer me up and keeps me optimistic about college.
            On move in day, we both got to meet each others families and after they left, we decorated our room together. We hung up a ton of pictures and prints on the walls and color coordinated our bedding.
            Ever since then we've always cleaned our room and done laundry together. We make it fun by using it as time to catch up.

            My roommate and I are super lucky because we are so similar to each other. We are both night owls, but unfortunately ended up with 8am classes. We've definitely been taking turns keeping each other accoutnable on when we go to bed, and making sure that we actually show up to our morning classes.
            Since moving in, we've introduced each other to our high school friends and the new people we've met in college, and we've found that we actually have a lot of mutual friends that we hadn't known about!
            Overall, it's been really fun having another person to share my day with, and I've realized that all my worries about dorm life were for nothing.
