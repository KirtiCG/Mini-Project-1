            My roomate's name is Nishka. She is an Aerospace major from Marietta,GA. She went to Wheeler High School and is super smart!
            She actually has a twin sister named Niti who lives across the hall from us. We are super lucky because we all live in Towers, and we got a corner room.
            Our favorite parts about the room are the windows (we get two!!!) and the fairy lights we put up! We always have snacks in our room because we are usually hungry, and I love to procrastinate my homework with food.
            Her favorite snacks are Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Hot Cheetos.
